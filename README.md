# Algorithms

Just some practice on common algorithms in various languages.

## Notes:

1. N operations on N objects takes quadtratic time, which is much too slow. We can't accept quadratic time to solve large problems.

### Quick Find

1. `quickFind.js` is too slow for large problems because it uses quadratic time.

### Quick Union

2. `quickUnion.js` makes connections much faster but is a bit slower in determining if two nodes are connected.
